# Daily Schedule Planner

## What this Project does

This project is a refactor. Using the existing HTML and CSS, JavaScript was added to include functionality in the application.

## What can the [Daily Schedule Planner](https://jeevanmkj.github.io/daily_shedule_planner/) do?

A user can organise their daily work hour activities. The application displays the date and time as well as indicates in the schedule what time block it is. All input is saved to local storage, as such when a user reloads the page the input values remain in their assigned input fields.

- Displays date and time
- Displays time window in schedule
- Log activities in schedule
- Saved to local storage
